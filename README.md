# Date and Time Picker Dialog

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
This dialog allows the user to select a date or a range of dates. Activate by calling the showDatePicker function, which returns a Future<DateTime>

TimePickerDialog is a dialog that presents a time picker. It can be activated by calling the showTimePicker() function. Instead of returning a Future<DateTime>, showTimePicker instead returns a Future<TimeOfDay

This project is a Flutter learning application.
